# Iris_classification-Python

The Iris classification dataset contains observations of a number of iris flowers. The details of their sepal width, sepal length, petal width and petal length are observed and noted. They have also been classified into 3 classes namely :

1.Iris-setosa

2.Iris-virginica

3.Iris-versicolor

A portion of this dataset is used to train a model to classify an Iris flower to its respective class. The other portion of this dataset is used to test the model.

Two different approaches are used to train the model namely:

1.K-nearest neighbhor

2.Neural Networks (Keras)

Further the concept of One hot encoding is used so that the Neural Networks (Keras) model can accurately classify the Iris flowers. The working of this concept is explained in the jupypter notebook.

The code for performing the same operation in R is present in the "Iris_classification-R" repository.

Thank You

Have a great day.
